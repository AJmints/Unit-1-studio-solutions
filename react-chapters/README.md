# React Section Review

This is an example of the React Sections/Exercises/Studios

This example is using the TypeScript template instead of JavaScript.
The command used when making a React app with TypeScript is...

"npx create-react-app "your apps name" --template typescript"

This particular example is using routing, which you aren't expected to know yet,
but this concept will be very useful as you progress in your web developer journey.

If you want to know how to set up routing, the command you have to run in the
repo where your react app lives is

"npm i react-router-dom".

Here is some documentation from the source on routing
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom>

## How to navigate the file tree

Inside the src folder is where you will find components, then you will see the
folders of the parts of the curriculum.

For folders with lots of components, the convention I will use is making a component
called AppRoute. That is what I will assign to the route in the App.tsx file in the
main src folder. This just means, AppRoute.tsx is being treated as App.tsx.
